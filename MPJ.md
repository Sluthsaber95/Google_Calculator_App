Hi there MPJ, this was a project in my early JavaScript Days.

Was wondering if you give the viewers a chance to know what code NOT to write

## Where to Start?
```
npm install
```

### :see_no_evil: TDD
Whilst reviewing the code, and making changes please can run tests, just to make sure the code doesn't break upon changes

```
npm test
```
## Review Anything
I should be embarressed by this code, but I've trangressed and got a JavaScript from creating code like this one, and many others after.

Please note that everything is fair game and if you like you review more or less of what I have recommended to you folks.

## ðŸŽ‰ Thank You & Good Luck
The code to say the least is pretty janky, please could you advocate to viewers that IS NOT the kind of code one would like to write. THANK YOU !!
